WayFlow
=======

*Robust AI-powered assistants for task automation and enhanced user experiences.*

**WayFlow** is a powerful, intuitive Python library for building advanced AI-powered assistants.
It offers a standard library of modular building blocks to streamline the creation of both
workflow-based and agent-style assistants, encourages reusability and speeds up the development process.

With WayFlow you can build both structured :ref:`Flows <flow>` and autonomous :ref:`Agents <agent>`, giving you complete
flexibility and allowing you to choose the paradigm that best fits your use case.

.. rubric:: Why WayFlow?

WayFlow has several advantages over other existing open-source frameworks:

* **Flexibility**: WayFlow supports multiple approaches to building AI Assistants, including Agents and Flows.
* **Interoperability**: WayFlow works with LLMs from many different vendors and supports an open approach to integration.
* **Reusability**: Build reusable and composable components to enable rapid development of AI Assistants.
* **Extensibility**: WayFlow has powerful abstractions to handle all types of LLM applications and provides a standard library of steps.
* **Openness**: We want to build a community and welcome contributions from diverse teams looking to take the next step in open-source AI Agents.

.. rubric:: Quick start

To install WayFlow from PyPI:

.. only:: stable

   To install ``wayflowcore`` (on Python 3.10), use the following command to install it from PyPI:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :substitutions:

      pip install "|package_name|==|stable_release|"

.. only:: dev

   To install ``wayflowcore`` (on Python 3.10), use the following command to install it from source:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :substitutions:

      bash install-dev.sh

For full details on installation including what Python versions and platforms are supported please see our :doc:`installation guide<installation>`.

With WayFlow installed, you can now try it out.

WayFlow supports several LLM API providers. First choose an LLM from one of the options below:

.. include:: _components/llm_config_tabs.rst

Then create an agent and have a conversation with it, as shown in the code below:

.. literalinclude:: code_examples/quickstart.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: .. full-code:
   :end-before: .. end-full-code

.. tip::
   **Self Hosted Models**: If you are interested in using locally hosted models, please see our guide on using them with WayFlow, :doc:`How to install Ollama <howtoguides/installing_ollama>`.
