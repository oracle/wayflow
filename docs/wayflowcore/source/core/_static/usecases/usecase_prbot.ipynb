    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this use-case tutorial, you will build a more advanced WayFlow application, a **Pull Request (PR) Reviewing Assistant**, using a WayFlow Flow to automate basic reviews of Python source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn the basics of using Flows to build an assistant.\n",
    "2. Learn how to compose multiple sub-flows to create a more complex Flow.\n",
    "3. Learn more about building Tools that can be used within your Flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the task\n",
    "\n",
    "Code reviews are crucial for maintaining code quality and reviewers often spend considerable time pointing out routine issues such as the presence of debug statements, formatting inconsistencies, or common coding convention violations that may not be fully captured by static code analysis tools. This consumes valuable time that could be spent on reviewing more important things such as the core logic, architecture, and business requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building an agent with WayFlow to perform such code reviews has a number of advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review rules can be written using natural language. This can make an agent much more flexible than simple static checker.\n",
    "2. More general issues can be captured. You can allow the LLM to infer from the rule to more general cases that could be missed by a simple static checker.\n",
    "3. New review rules can be learned by looking at comment traces\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will create a WayFlow Flow assistant designed to scan Python pull requests for common oversights such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Having TODO comments without associated tickets.\n",
    "2. Using unclear or ambiguous variable naming.\n",
    "3. Using risky Python code practices such as mutable defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build this assistant you will break the task into configuration and two sub-flows that will be composed into a single flow:"

    "\n",
    "#### Format diff to string, `format_diff_to_string_step`\n",
    "\n",
    "This step converts the file diff list into a string so that it can be used by the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done with the `string` Jinja filter as follows: `{{ message | string }}`. It uses an [OutputMessageStep](https://TODO/development/docs/api/flows.html#wayflowcore.steps.outputmessagestep.OutputMessageStep)\n",
    "to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add lines to the diff, `add_lines_on_diff_step`\n",
    "\n",
    "This step prefixes the diff with the line numbers required to review comments. It uses a, [ToolExecutionStep](https://TODO/development/docs/api/flows.html#wayflowcore.steps.toolexecutionstep.ToolExecutionStep), to run the\n",
    "tool that you previously defined in order to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the tool, within the I/O dictionary, is specified using the `input_mapping`. For all these steps, it is important to remember\n",
    "that the outputs of one step are linked to the inputs of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extract file path, `extract_file_path_step`\n",
    "\n",
    "This extracts the file path from the diff string. The file path is needed for assigning the review comments. The [RegexExtractionStep](https://TODO/development/docs/api/flows.html#wayflowcore.steps.textextractionstep.regexextractionstep.RegexExtractionStep) step\n",
    "is used to extract the file path from the diff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression is applied to the diff string, extracted form the input map using the ``input_mapping`` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Compared to the [RegexExtractionStep](https://TODO/development/docs/api/flows.html#wayflowcore.steps.textextractionstep.regexextractionstep.RegexExtractionStep) used in Part 1, here only the first matchs is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generate comments, `generate_comments_step`\n",
    "\n",
    "This generates comments using the LLM and the prompt template defined earlier. The [PromptExecutionStep](https://TODO/development/docs/api/flows.html#wayflowcore.steps.promptexecutionstep.PromptExecutionStep) step executes\n",
    "the prompt with the LLM defined earlier in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the list of checks has already been defined, the template can be pre-rendered using the `render_template_partially` method. This renders the parts of the\n",
    "template that have been provided, while the remaining information is gathered from the I/O dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extract comments from JSON, `extract_comments_from_json_step`\n",
    "\n",
    "This extracts the comments and line numbers from the generated LLM output, which is a serialized JSON structure due to the prompt used.\n",
    "A [ExtractValueFromJsonStep](https://TODO/development/docs/api/flows.html#wayflowcore.steps.textextractionstep.extractvaluefromjsonstep.ExtractValueFromJsonStep) is used to do the extraction. When creating the step, specify the following in addition to the usual `input_mapping` and `output_mapping`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `output_values`: This defines the [JQ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) query to extract the comments form the JSON generated by the LLM.\n",
    "* `llms`: An LLM that can be used to help resolve any parsing errors. This is related to `retry`.\n",
    "* `retry`: If parsing fails, you may want to retry. This is set to `True`, which results in trying to use the the LLM to help resolve any such issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create the sub-flow, `generate_comments_subflow`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you define what steps are in the sub-flow, what the transitions between the steps are and what will be the starting step. This is exactly\n",
    "the same process you did previously when defining the sub-flow to fetch the PR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying the comment generation to all file diffs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the sub-flow create, you need to apply it to every file diff. This is done using a [MapStep](https://TODO/development/docs/api/flows.html#wayflowcore.steps.mapstep.MapStep). `MapStep` takes a sub-flow as input, in this case, the `generate_comments_subflow`,\n",
    "and applies it to an iterable—in this case, the list of file diffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You simply specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `flow`: The sub-flow to map, that is applied to the iterable.\n",
    "* `unpack_input`: Defines how to unpack the input. A [JQ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)  query can be used to transform the input, but in this case, it is kept as a list.\n",
    "* `input_mapping`: Defines what the sub-flow will iterate over. The key, [MapStep.ITERATED_INPUT](https://TODO/development/docs/api/flows.html#wayflowcore.steps.mapstep.MapStep.ITERATED_INPUT), is used to pass in the diffs.\n",
    "* `output_descriptors`: Specifies the values to collect from the output generated by applying the sub-flow. In this case, these will be the generated comments and the associated file path.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "   The :ref:`MapStep <mapstep>` works similarly to how the Python map function works. For more information, see\n",
    "   https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, create the sub-flow to generate all comments using the helper method ``create_single_step_flow``.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing the sub-flow\n",
    "\n",
    "You can test the sub-flow by creating a conversation, as shown in the code below, and specifying the inputs as done in, `Part 2: Retrieve the PR diff information`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each sub-flow is tested independently, you can reuse the output from the first sub-flow."
