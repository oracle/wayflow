        Python script/notebook for this guide.

.. admonition:: Prerequisites

    This guide assumes familiarity with

    - :doc:`Agents <../tutorials/basic_agent>`
    - :doc:`Flows <../tutorials/basic_flow>`


Agents rely on access to relevant data to function effectively.
Without a steady stream of high-quality data, AI models are unable to learn, reason, or make informed decisions.
Connecting an Agent or Flow to data sources is therefore a critical step in developing functional AI systems.
This connection enables agents to perceive their environment, update their knowledge or the underlying data source, and adapt to changing conditions.

In this tutorial, you will:

- **Define Entities** that an Agent or Flow can access and manipulate.
- **Populate a Datastore** with entities for development and testing.
- **Use Datastores in Flows and Agents** to create two types of inventory management assistants.

To ensure reproducibility of this tutorial, you will use an in-memory data source.

Concepts shown in this guide
============================

- :ref:`Entities <entity>` to model data
- :ref:`Datastore <datastore>` and :ref:`InMemoryDatastore <inmemorydatastore>` to manipulate collections of data
- Steps to use datastores in Agents and Flows (:ref:`DatastoreListStep <datastoreliststep>`, :ref:`DatastoreCreateStep <datastorecreatestep>`, :ref:`DatastoreUpdateStep <datastoreupdatestep>`, :ref:`DatastoreDeleteStep <datastoredeletestep>`)

.. note::
   The :ref:`InMemoryDatastore <inmemorydatastore>` is mainly suitable for testing and development,
   or other use-cases where data persistence across assistants and conversations is not a requirement.
   For production use-cases, the :ref:`OracleDatabaseDatastore <oracledatabasedatastore>` provides a
   robust and scalable persistence layer in Oracle Database.

   Note that there are a few key differences between an in-memory and a database ``Datastore``:
   - With database Datastores, all tables relevant to the assistant must already be created in the database prior to connecting to it.
   - You may choose to only model a subset of the tables available in the database via the :ref:`Entity <entity>` construct.
   - Database Datastores offer an additional ``query`` method (and the corresponding :ref:`DatastoreQueryStep <datastorequerystep>`),
   that enables flexible execution of SQL queries that cannot be modelled by the ``list`` operation on the in-memory datastore

Datastores in Flows
===================

In this section, you will build a simple Flow that performs operations on an inventory database based on user input.
This Flow helps users keep product descriptions up to date by leveraging an LLM for the creative writing component.

Step 1. Add imports and LLM configuration
-----------------------------------------

Import the required packages:

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :start-after: .. start-##_Imports
   :end-before: .. end-##_Imports

In this assistant, you need to use an LLM.
WayFlow supports several LLM API providers.
Select an LLM from the options below:

.. include:: ../_components/llm_config_tabs.rst

.. important::
    API keys should not be stored anywhere in the code. Use environment variables and/or tools such as `python-dotenv <https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/>`_.

Step 2. Define data
-------------------

Start by defining the schema for your data using the :ref:`Entity <entity>` construct.
In this example, you will manage products in an inventory, so a single collection is sufficient.
Datastores also support managing multiple collections at the same time if needed.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :start-after: .. start-##_Create_entities
   :end-before: .. end-##_Create_entities

Next, create an :ref:`InMemoryDataStore <inmemorydatastore>`.
For simplicity, you will use dummy data:

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :start-after: .. start-##_Create_datastore
   :end-before: .. end-##_Create_datastore

Step 3. Create datastore steps
------------------------------

Now that the Datastore is set up, create steps to perform different operations in the flow.
In this case, the assistant only needs to retrieve the current description of products and update it.
See :ref:`the list of all available Datastore steps <datastoresteps>` for more details.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :start-after: .. start-##_Create_Datastore_step
   :end-before: .. end-##_Create_Datastore_step

Key points:

- Use ``where`` to filter which product to list and update. Configure it with a variable so that the user can dynamically choose the product title.
- In the ``DatastoreListStep``, ``limit`` and ``unpack_single_entity_from_list`` are used to assume that product titles are unique, making the output concise and easy to handle.

The input to the ``DatastoreListStep`` is the title of the product to retrieve, and the output is a single object containing the corresponding product data.
The input to the ``DatastoreUpdateStep`` includes both the title of the product to update and the updates to apply, in the form of a dictionary containing the properties and the corresponding values.
The output will be the new properties that were updated.

Step 4. Create the Flow
-----------------------

Now define the :ref:`Flow <flow>` for this assistant.

After the user enters which product they want to update, and how the description should be updated, the datastore is queried to find the matching product.
The LLM is prompted with the product details and the user's instructions.
The output is used to update the data, and the new result is returned back to the user.

   .. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
      :language: python
      :linenos:
      :start-after: .. start-##_Create_flow
      :end-before: .. end-##_Create_flow

Note the use of structured generation in the ``PromptExecutionStep`` (via the ``output_descriptors`` parameter).
This ensures that the LLM generates exactly the structure expected by the ``DatastoreUpdateStep``.

Finally, verify that the Flow works:

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
      :language: python
      :linenos:
      :start-after: .. start-##_Execute_flow
      :end-before: .. end-##_Execute_flow


Datastores in Agents
====================

This section assumes you have completed the previous steps on using datastores in Flows.

The Flow you built earlier is quite helpful and reliable because it performs a single, specialized task.
Next, you will see how to define an Agent for inventory management when the task is not defined in advance.
This Agent will be able to interpret the user's requests and autonomously decide which actions on the ``Datastore`` are required to fulfill each task.

Step 1. Add imports and LLM configuration
-----------------------------------------

Add the additional imports needed to use Agents:

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
      :language: python
      :linenos:
      :start-after: .. start-##_Import_agents
      :end-before: .. end-##_Import_agents

Step 2. Create Datastore Flows for an Agent
-------------------------------------------

To use the  ``Datastore`` in an agent, create flows for the different operations you want the agent to perform.
In the simplest setup, you can define one flow per basic ``Datastore`` operation.
The agent will then determine the correct sequence of actions to achieve the user's goal.

Define flows for:

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
      :language: python
      :linenos:
      :start-after: .. start-##_Create_agent_flows
      :end-before: .. end-##_Create_agent_flows

Notice the provided descriptions for the flows to help the agent understand the objective of each operation.

Additionally, you can incorporate more complex behaviors into these flows.
For example, you could ask for user confirmation before deleting entities, or you could provide the user with an overview, and an editing option of the updates made by the agent before they are applied.

Step 3. Create the Agent
------------------------

Finally, create the inventory management agent by combining the LLM, the datastore flows, and a custom instruction:

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
      :language: python
      :linenos:
      :start-after: .. start-##_Create_agent
      :end-before: .. end-##_Create_agent

This agent can now respond to the user and perform actions on the data on their behalf.

Refer to the :doc:`WayFlow Agents Tutorial <../tutorials/basic_agent>` to see how to run this Agent.


Agent Spec Exporting/Loading
============================

You can export the assistant configuration to its Agent Spec configuration using the ``AgentSpecExporter``.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Export_config_to_Agent_Spec
    :end-before: .. end-##_Export_config_to_Agent_Spec


Here is what the **Agent Spec representation will look like â†“**

      .. tab:: JSON

         .. literalinclude:: ../config_examples/howto_datastores.json
            :language: json

      .. tab:: YAML

         .. literalinclude:: ../config_examples/howto_datastores.yaml
            :language: yaml


You can then load the configuration back to an assistant using the ``AgentSpecLoader``.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_datastores.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Load_Agent_Spec_config
    :end-before: .. end-##_Load_Agent_Spec_config

.. note::

    This guide uses the following extension/plugin Agent Spec components:
