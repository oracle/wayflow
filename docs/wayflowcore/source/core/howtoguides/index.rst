How-to Guides
=============

Within this section, you will find answers to "How do I..." types of questions.
The proposed guides are goal-oriented and concrete, as they are meant to help you complete a specific task.
Each code example in these how-to guides is self-contained and can be executed with :doc:`WayFlow <../index>`.

For comprehensive, end-to-end walkthroughs, refer to the :doc:`Tutorials <../tutorials/index>`.
For detailed descriptions of every class and function, see the :doc:`API Reference <../api/index>`.


Building Assistants
-------------------

WayFlow offers a wide range of features for building :ref:`Agents <agent>`, :ref:`Flows <flow>` as well
as multi-agent patterns such as :doc:`hierarchical multi-agent <howto_multiagent>` and :ref:`Swarm <swarm>`.
These how-to guides demonstrate how to use the main features to create and customize your assistants.

Tools in Assistants
-------------------

Equipping AI assistants with tools unlock key capabilities such as being able to fetch data,
take action, and connect to external data and systems. These guides cover how to leverage the
several tools features available in WayFlow, such as :ref:`server-side tools <servertool>`,
:ref:`client-side tools <clienttool>`, tools to perform :ref:`remote API calls <remotetool>`,
and support for :ref:`Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools <mcptool>`.
