.. admonition:: Prerequisites

    This guide assumes familiarity with :doc:`Agents <../tutorials/basic_agent>`.

With the advent of increasingly powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), multi-agent systems are becoming more relevant
and are expected to be particularly valuable in scenarios requiring high-levels of autonomy and/or processing
of diverse sources of information.

There are various types of multi-agent systems, each serving different purposes and applications.
Some notable examples include hierarchical structures, agent swarms, and mixtures of agents.

This guide demonstrates an example of a hierarchical multi-agent system (also known as manager-workers pattern) and will show you how to:

- Build expert agents equipped with tools and an manager agent;
- Test the expert agents individually;
- Build a ManagerWorkers using the defined agents;
- Execute the ManagerWorkers of agents;

(customer service agent) and two expert agents equipped with tools (refund specialist
and satisfaction surveyor).

    To access short code snippets demonstrating how to use other agentic patterns in WayFlow,
    refer to the :doc:`Reference Sheet <../misc/reference_sheet>`.


To follow this guide, you need an LLM. WayFlow supports several LLM API providers.
Select an LLM from the options below:

.. include:: ../_components/llm_config_tabs.rst

Building and testing expert Agents
==================================

In this guide you will use the following helper function to print
messages:

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Helper_method_for_printing_conversation_messages
    :end-before: .. end-##_Helper_method_for_printing_conversation_messages

API Reference: :ref:`MessageType <messagetype>`

Refund specialist agent
-----------------------

The refund specialist agent is equipped with two tools.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Specialist_tools
    :end-before: .. end-##_Specialist_tools

API Reference: :ref:`tool <tooldecorator>`

The first tool is used to check whether a given order is eligible for a refund,
while the second is used to process the specific refund.

System prompt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Specialist_prompt
    :end-before: .. end-##_Specialist_prompt

.. important::

    The quality of the system prompt is paramount to ensuring proper behaviour of the multi-agent
    system, because slight deviations in the behaviour can lead to cascading
    unintended effects as the number of agents scales up.

Building the Agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Specialist_agent
    :end-before: .. end-##_Specialist_agent

API Reference: :ref:`Agent <agent>`

Testing the Agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Specialist_test
    :end-before: .. end-##_Specialist_test

Test the agents individually to ensure they perform as expected.


Statisfaction surveyor agent
----------------------------

Tools
^^^^^

The statisfaction surveyor agent is equipped with one tool.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Surveyor_tools
    :end-before: .. end-##_Surveyor_tools


The ``record_survey_response`` tool is simulating the recording of
user feedback data.


System prompt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Surveyor_prompt
    :end-before: .. end-##_Surveyor_prompt


Building the Agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Surveyor_agent
    :end-before: .. end-##_Surveyor_agent


Testing the Agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Surveyor_test
    :end-before: .. end-##_Surveyor_test


Again, the expert agent behaves as intended.

Manager Agent
-------------

In the our built-in ManagerWorkers component, we allow passing an Agent
as the group manager. Therefore, we just need to define an agent as usual.

In this example, our manager agent will be a Customer Service Manager.

System prompt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Manager_prompt
    :end-before: .. end-##_Manager_prompt

Building the manager Agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Manager_agent
    :end-before: .. end-##_Manager_agent


Building and testing ManagerWorkers of Agents
=============================================

Building the ManagerWorkers of Agents
-------------------------------------


.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Managerworkers_pattern
    :end-before: .. end-##_Managerworkers_pattern

API Reference: :ref:`ManagerWorkers <managerworkers>`

The ManagerWorkers has two main parameters:

- ``group_manager``
  This can be either an Agent or an LLM.

  - If an LLM is provided, a manager agent will automatically be created using that LLM along with the default ``custom_instruction`` for group managers.
  - In this example, we explicitly pass an Agent (the *Customer Service Manager Agent*) so we can use our own defined ``custom_instruction``.

- ``workers`` - List of Agents
  These agents serve as the workers within the group and are coordinated by the manager agent.

  - Worker agents cannot interact with the end user directly.
  - When invoked, each worker can leverage its equipped tools to complete the assigned task and report the result back to the group manager.

Executing the ManagerWorkers
----------------------------

The power of mult-agent systems is their high adaptiveness.
In the following example, it is demonstrated how the manager can decide
not to call the expert agents for simple user queries.


.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Managerworkers_answers_without_expert
    :end-before: .. end-##_Managerworkers_answers_without_expert

However, the manager is explicitly prompted to assign to the specialized agents for more complex tasks.
This is demonstrated in the following example.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Managerworkers_answers_with_expert
    :end-before: .. end-##_Managerworkers_answers_with_expert


Agent Spec Exporting/Loading
============================

You can export the assistant configuration to its Agent Spec configuration using the ``AgentSpecExporter``
and the ManagerWorkers plugin. Using the plugin ensures the proper serialization of
the custom ManagerWorkers component.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Export_config_to_Agent_Spec
    :end-before: .. end-##_Export_config_to_Agent_Spec

And load it back using the ``AgentSpecLoader``.

Similar to the serialization, use the Managerworkers deserialization plugin to ensure the proper deserialization of
the custom ManagerWorkers component.

.. literalinclude:: ../code_examples/howto_managerworkers.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: .. start-##_Load_Agent_Spec_config
    :end-before: .. end-##_Load_Agent_Spec_config
