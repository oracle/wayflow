Changelog
=========

WayFlow 26.1.0
--------------

Possibly Breaking Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Removed deprecated Agent/Flow.execute:**

  Removed the deprecated method of `Agent/Flow.execute(conversation)` in favor of conversation.execute().

WayFlow 25.4.2
--------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Added Tool Confirmation before Execution:**
  Introduced a `requires_confirmation` flag to the base Tool Class. When enabled, this flag will pause tool execution and emit a `ToolExecutionConfirmationStatus`, requiring explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
  During confirmation, users may edit the tool’s arguments or provide a rejection reason. The tool executes only after confirmation is granted.

  For more information check out :doc:`the corresponding how-to guide <howtoguides/howto_userconfirmation>`

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* **Flow input and output descriptors**

  Fixed a bug where Flow input and output descriptors were sometimes ignored:

  - All the inputs required by the steps that compose the Flow were used instead of the input descriptors provided.
  - The intersection of all the outputs generated by any branch in the Flow was used instead of the output descriptors provided.

  The behavior is now:

  - Input descriptors can now be a subset of all the inputs required by the steps that compose the Flow,
    as long as the missing step inputs have a default value.
  - Output descriptors can be a subset of the intersection of all the outputs generated by any branch in the Flow.
    This is now correctly reflected also in other parts of the package.


Miscellaneous
