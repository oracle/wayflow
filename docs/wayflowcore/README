# Building the docs

To build the docs, run the command `make html`.
Note: The above command should be run from `docs/wayflowcore` folder.

Note: the project should be installed in editable mode. Please refer
to [the main README.md](../README.md).

# Deploying the docs

## Deploying the main docs

After building the docs, they can be deployed with a simple Python HTTP server:
``
cd build/html
python3 -m http.server 7860
``

# Writing the docs

When adding new functionality, ask yourself whether it should be part
of the API for users of the `wayflowcore` library. If not, it should probably be marked
as non-public with a leading underscore (`_foo`). In this case, it will
not be included in the generated documentation.

All public classes, methods and functions should have a docstring,
ideally following the [numpydoc
standard](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html).

To add a new public class or module in the documentation, add an
`autoclass` or `automodule` command in the `.rst` files inside the
`docs/wayflowcore/source` folder.

Additional notes:

-    Accurate type annotations will improve the documentation.
     Optionally, it is also possible to provide a parameter type in the
     docstring, which overrides the type annotation. This is usually
     not necessary.
-    Default parameter values are automatically included in the
     documentation. They don't need to be added in the docstring.
